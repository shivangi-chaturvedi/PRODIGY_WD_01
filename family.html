    <h2>Daddy</h2>
    <p>I love my daddy so much. Though he is not the best father of the world but still he is the one whom I love the most. There use to be times when we use to fight too much but still we care about each other too much. People say that a daughter inherits behavioural pattern of her father, but I think I dont't follow many of his behaviours. We have too much differences. But still we love each other a lot.</p>

    <h2>Mummy</h2>
    <p>My mom is the jolliest person of my life. Without her my home would be like an old man who has no appetite of happiness.</p>
