    <p>Singing is my first and foremost hobby. I have been passionate about it since I was a child. It brings me a great sense of a joy and fulfillment. I started singing when I was in school.Both my brain and heart start working great when I start singing. I use to have wonderful fun when I sing a song. </p>
    <p>My fascination with singing is rooted in its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. </p>

    <h2>Dancing...</h2>

    <p>Dancing makes me feel happy and relaxed, thus I love to dance. I always participate in dance competitions at my school and have even won a few. Dance became my passion from an early age. Listening to the beats of a dance number, I started to tap my feet and my parents recognized my talent for dance.</p>
    <p>Once John Weaver said-"Dancing is an elegant, and regular movement, harmoniously composed of beautiful Attitudes, and contrasted graceful Posture of the Body, and parts thereof.‚Äù</p>
